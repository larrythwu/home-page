# Larry's Vanilla HTML/CSS Portfolio

This is a vanilla HTML/CSS version of Larry Wu's portfolio website, converted from a React application.

## Structure

- `index.html` - Home page with personal information
- `paintings.html` - Gallery of paintings
- `photography.html` - Gallery of photographs
- `resume.html` - Resume page (placeholder)
- `projects.html` - Projects page (placeholder)
- `css/styles.css` - Main stylesheet for all pages
- `images/` - Directory containing all images:
  - `images/paintings/` - Paintings images
  - `images/photography/` - Photography images

## How to Use

1. Simply open any of the HTML files in a web browser to view the website.
2. All pages are static HTML, so no server is required to run the site.
3. You can host these files on any basic web hosting service.

## Navigation

- The navigation bar at the top allows movement between different sections.
- All pages share the same layout and design consistency.

## Features

- Responsive layout that works on mobile and desktop
- Photo galleries with captions
- Clean, minimalist design

## Differences from React Version

- No component-based architecture - all HTML is static
- No React dependencies
- Simpler file structure

## Customization

To customize this site:
1. Edit the HTML files to change content
2. Modify styles.css to change the appearance
3. Replace or add images in the images directory
